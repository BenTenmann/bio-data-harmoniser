# bio-data-harmoniser

Automatically ingest and harmonise biological data from different sources.

## About

Biomedical data is messy and disharmonised. This tool aims to help researchers ingest and harmonise biological data from
different sources, to make it easier to get insights from the data.

## Usage

In general, we recommend using Docker to run the tool. You can use the following command to start the tool:

```bash
make run_in_docker
```

This will start the tool in a Docker container. You can access the tool at `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.
